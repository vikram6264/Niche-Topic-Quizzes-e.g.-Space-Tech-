## Project Description
The Niche-Topic Quizzes smart contract allows users to participate in quizzes based on specific niches such as Space, Technology, or other specialized fields. Each quiz consists of a question, a correct answer, and a reward in the form of tokens for the participants who answer correctly.

The contract is designed for creating and managing quizzes, submitting answers, and distributing rewards to correct responders.

## Project Vision
The vision for this project is to create an engaging and rewarding quiz platform that allows users to learn and test their knowledge in niche areas such as space, technology, gaming, and more. The integration of blockchain ensures that quizzes are transparent, tamper-proof, and reward-based. By leveraging smart contracts, we can provide an incentive-driven platform for knowledge-sharing while promoting niche topics.

The long-term goal is to expand the quiz platform to include a variety of topics, enhance the user interface, and integrate with decentralized applications (dApps) for a seamless experience.

## Key Features

- **Create Quizzes:** Admins (owners) can create quizzes with custom topics, questions, and rewards.
- **Answer Questions:** Users can submit answers to quizzes, which are validated based on correctness.
- **Reward Distribution:** Users who answer correctly are rewarded with tokens (ERC-20 or native blockchain tokens).
- **Transparency:** All quiz results and rewards are visible on the blockchain, ensuring transparency.
- **Quiz Deactivation:** The owner can deactivate quizzes once they're no longer active or relevant.
- **Secure and Tamper-Proof:** The use of smart contracts ensures that the quizzes and results are secure and cannot be altered after the fact.
